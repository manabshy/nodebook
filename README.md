Social Network just like Facebook built using - MEAN Stack.
This is the initial draft of the project - however, the project is still under development. I initially wrote this using jQuery and then slowly transition into AngularJS.
At the moment - still the AJAX calls are constructed using jQuery, but they will be changing into https - AngularJS.
The project is initially derived from the base project - https://github.com/jdolitsky/nodejscourse and then worked on top of that. I will be contributing to this repository
when I feel the project is complete :-). However,it is functional and can be forked.  

The Login page is built, users can comment and delete the posts,put their comments etc. 
My database is hosted at MongoLab. You could use your own instance of your mongoDB running at your local PC. I am MAC user, so I would recommend using it, but nothing stop Windows user to start experimenting. The project is also hosted on Heroku. you could access it via the url below.

Feel free to use it or comment for any improvement.

##Description

The three sections will be divided as follows:

###1. Intro to Node.js
We will help you get your computer setup to run Node.js. You will learn the basics behind Node.js and NPM, the package manager for Node.js. We will build a basic web server using the package Express and learn how to code up dynamic web pages using EJS.

###2. Adding user profiles using MongoDB
This section will focus on connecting your app to a database, specifically MongoDB, a popular choice for Node. We will use the package Mongoose to set up user models, and write some HTML forms to insert, update, and delete from the database. We will explore URL routing and create custom user profiles.

###3. Advanced Node.js topics
In this section we will wrap up the social network app, adding things such as a Facebook wall feature for users to interact with each other. We will explore session management and user authentication, as well as advanced Node.js techniques using the realtime package Socket.io.
