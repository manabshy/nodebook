Front end  -  is developed using Bootstrap,CSS3,HTML5,EJS Template - for the views
Middleware -  Express,NodeJs
Backend    -  MongoDb
Deployment -  Have also deployed this web app to Heroku. For this web app - I am connecting to the instance of the mongoDB running on
MongoLab.
I will be writing an article about deploying and hosting your NodeJs web app specifially on Heroku.
