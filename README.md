Social Network just like Facebook built using - MEAN Stack.
This is the initial draft of the project - however, the project is still under development. I initially wrote this using jQuery and then slowly transition into AngularJS.
At the moment - still the AJAX calls are constructed using jQuery, but they will be changing into https - AngularJS.
The project is initially derived from the base project - https://github.com/jdolitsky/nodejscourse and then worked on top of that. I will be contributing to this repository
when I feel the project is complete :-). However,it is functional and can be forked.  

The Login page is built, users can comment and delete the posts,put their comments etc. 
My database is hosted at MongoLab. You could use your own instance of your mongoDB running at your local PC. I am a MAC user, so I would recommend using it, but nothing stops Windows users to start experimenting. The project is also hosted on Heroku. you could access it via the url below. 

Feel free to use it or comment for any improvement.
